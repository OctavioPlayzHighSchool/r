    <h1>My Codeing Experience</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I love to code, I was 6 years old when I first touched a Computer on my own so naturally I know alot about Computers. I might not know everything about computers but I have the ability to learn anything on comuters online or just basic sutff really fast. When it comes to advanced stuff that's when I start to have lots of fun even if I work alot slower due to confussion</p>
    <h2>The Way I Learn To Code</h2>
    <p>When Im new to a language or computer program I watch other people use it or look at some of there source code for reference of the many tiny projects I do I love to share my code and see other people have fun useing my code it brings me genuine happyness.</p>
